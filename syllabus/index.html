<p>This is a draft of the syllabus which is not yet finalized for Spring 2025. It is subject to change until distributed on the first day of class. The course website is managed through a <a href="https://github.com/uvadmt/uvadmt.github.io">public github repository</a>, so you can see past versions there. <!-- The version as posted on the first day of class is [here](https://github.com/uvatoc/uvatoc.github.io/blob/860ed1c214bc1deefbf8d590a7b506f6f01af698/syllabus/index.html). --></p>
</div>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Official Course Description.</strong> This is the official course description from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241201222104/https://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=61&amp;coid=401199">Undergraduate Record</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introduces discrete mathematics and proof techniques involving first order predicate logic and induction. Application areas include sets, tuples, functions, relations, and combinatorial problems. Prereq: CS 1100 - CS 1199</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Unofficial Course Description.</strong> Our course will match the official description, but the core goal of this course is to help students to understand, explain, and apply the foundational mathematical concepts at the core of computer science. The course has two main purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Develop your ability to <em>think</em> and <em>communicate</em> in a clear, mathematical way. We hope this will be useful throughout your life, but it is essential to becoming a strong computer scientist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce and gain understanding of the <em>mathematical objects</em>, <em>definitions</em>, <em>notations</em>, and <em>techniques</em> that will be essential for later computing courses where they will be used to reason about and develop algorithms, prove properties about programs, and understand the limits of different models of computation.</p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expected Background.</strong> Students entering the course are expected to have some experience with computer science including what is typically covered in a programming-focused first computing course such as cs 1110. You should be able to read and reason about short programs, and have a high-level undersanding of how programs execute. Students are also expected to have reasonable high school math background, but we do not assume background in calculus and rarely use any math beyond addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, and algebra.</p>
<p><strong>Materials.</strong> The primary textbook is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eric Lehman, F. Thomson Leighton, and Albert R. Meyer. <a href="/docs/mcs.pdf"><em>Mathematics for Computer Science</em></a>. (2018/6/6 version).  This book is
freely available on-line, and generously released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0</a> license.
License</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A web-based version of the textbook is also available from
<a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Mathematics_for_Computer_Science_(Lehman_Leighton_and_Meyer)">LibreTexts</a>. We believe the content is nearly identical to the <a href="/docs/mcs.pdf">PDF version</a>, but cannot guarantee it is entirely consistent.</p>
<p>The course will mostly cover the first part of this book (Chapters 1-8), and some selected materials from later chapters (in particular chapters 9, 15, 17).  In addition to that textbook, we will have selected readings from other sources.</p>

**Office Hours:** The full office hours schedule is available on the [course calendar](/schedule).
-->
<h2 id="main-topics">Main Topics</h2>
<p>The topics covered in DMT1 focus on developing the mathematical foundation and skills that are most important for computer science. Expected topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematical definitions</li>
<li>Propositions and proofs using first-order logic</li>
<li>Proof methods (including construction, contradiction, and induction)</li>
<li>Logic (Boolean logic, logical formulas, satisfiability, quantifiers)</li>
<li>Binary relations</li>
<li>Finite and infinite sets</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="communication">Communication</h1>
<p>We will primarily use the course website for posting course materials,
and use the course discord for interactive communications.</p>
<p><strong>Course Website:</strong> We will post nearly all course materials at
<a href="https://uvadmt.github.io"><em>https://uvadmt.github.io</em></a>. This is an open public website.</p>
<p><strong>Canvas:</strong> We will use UVA Canvas for managing course assignments. Everyone in the course should be in the canvas course site for their section.</p>
<p><strong>Discord:</strong> We will use the course discord server for most other
course communications (you will receive information on joining the
server by email). We expect students to receive messages we send to
the <code>#general</code> channel as well as any direct messages we send to you
on discord.</p>
<p>If you have questions about course materials or assignments that will
be relevant to other students, please ask them in the <code>#general</code>
channel. This will get the fastest response, since all of the course
staff and students will see your question there and be able to respond
to it.</p>
<p>Although Discord enables &ldquo;real time&rdquo; communication, you should not
expect instant answers to questions there, but should expect a
response within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> Managing email for a large class like this is difficult,
and you should use the course discord for questions about the course
content that are relevant to all students. If you have personal
questions or things to discuss with the course staff, please do this
by emailing TODO.</p>

### Early Submissions
Each problem set will have a stated deadline. Additionally, for students who submit more than 24 hours before the deadline, there is a small bonus to the assignment:

| Last Submission Time         | Bonus                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| At least 48 hours early      | +5% bonus (for a total of +10%)       |
| At least 24 hours early      | +5% bonus                            |
| On time                      | No bonus                                  |


Only your last submission will be graded.

<h2 id="assignments-and-exams">Assignments and Exams</h2>
<h2 id="additional-help">Additional help</h2>
<p>If you are struggling with the course we highly encourage you to utilize instructor and TA office hours.
For additional help, the engineering school also provides tutors (<a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/undergraduate-study/student-support/tutoring)">https://engineering.virginia.edu/undergraduate-study/student-support/tutoring)</a>.
If you are struggling with personal issues we encourage you to talk to your academic dean or SDAC if appropriate (<a href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center)">https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem Sets.</strong> Most learning in this course is done by working to
solve problems on your own and in collaboration with others. We will
have a problem set due most weeks in the course (typically on
TODO).  See the course calendar in Canvas for specific due
dates.</p>
<p>Each problem set will include specific directions for how to
submit your solutions, and we expect students to read and follow
these carefully. Each problem set will state a clear
collaboration policy (which typically will allow you to discuss
problems with others, but require that you write up your solutions
by yourself and understand everything in it) and we trust and expect
students to follow these policies vigilantly.</p>
<p><strong>Tests.</strong> We will have four (TODO:Check) in-class tests scheduled approximately every three weeks throughout the courses. These tests will be designed to check your understanding and ability to solve problems using ideas we have covered in class. They will emphasize material from the prior two problem sets, but may also include reivew questions on earlier class material. Tests will be done on your own, without using any resources other than a permitted single page of notes you prepare that will be permitted for some of the tests.</p>
<p><strong>Final Exam.</strong>  TODO</p>
<p><strong>Extensions and Late Submissions.</strong> Extensions will be granted to
individual students on a case-by-case basis. We are more likely to
respond positively to an extension request if it is made well before
an assignment is due and provides a reasonable justification for the
extension. To request an extension, use this form:</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/nZ5xQubeWbsss1bc8">cs2120 Extension Request Form</a></p>
<p>We are sympathetic to situations where a traumatic late event prevents
you from being able to complete an assignment, and appreciate you
bringing these to our attention even if the deadline has passed.</p>
<p>Other than the correct interpretation that an assignment submitted by the deadline or by the date given in a granted extension request, our late policy is to not have a late policy. This doesn&rsquo;t mean there is no way to get credit for a late assignment, and even if you have no excuse, it is always better to submit an assignment late than to not submit the assignment at all. Beyond that guideline, we will consider late assignments on a case-by-case basis that takes into account how late the assignment it, whether it is just one late assignment or a habitual problem, and any contextual information provided about the reason for the lateness.</p>
<p>If you find that you will be unable to make one of the scheduled tests or final exam, contact the course instructors immediately.</p>
<p><a href="classcontribution"></a><strong>Class Contribution.</strong> TODO</p>
<p><a name="bonus"></a> <strong>Bonus Points.</strong> We hope students will go beyond
the provided assignments and do other things to contribute to the
class as well as beyond. We provide some concrete opportunities for
this in the form of <em>Challenge Problems</em>, but also will award bonus
points for relevant and creative activities that students invent on
their own.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>We encourage students to spend your energy focusing on what you are
learning, instead of worrying about your grade.</p>
<p>That said, we understand students are often stressed about grading and
understandably want to know how grades will be determined.  We aim to
grade in a way that is useful (provides students with accurate measure
of how well they understood what they should), motivating (encourages
the behaviors we prefer, including hard but not obsessive work), fair
(assigned higher grades to more deserving students), robust (arbitrary
small perturbations do not have a material impact on someone&rsquo;s grade),
and low stress (for both students and the course staff).</p>
<p>For this reason, we choose not to prescribe a singular mathematical
formula for quantitatively assigning letter grades but do provide a
formula that can be used to compute a <em>lower bound</em> on the grade you
receive in the course:</p>
<center>
<table class="grades" style="width:100%;">

</center>
<p>With the exception of cases of academic dishonesty or inappropriate
behavior, you can be assured that your final grade will not be below the
grade that would result from computing your score using the
default weightings in the table, where your score for each item is the ratio
of the score you received to the target score for that item, and the
grading scale is based on the standard decades (e.g., 0.87 = B+, 0.9 =
A-, 0.93 = A).</p>
<p>This is a <em>minimum</em> grade expectation, though, and we generally want to assign a
grade that reflects the best possible interpretation of all you have
done during the semester. This means we consider your performance
throughout the course, and will examine grades using a variety of
different methods that weights different aspects differently and
rewards performance improvements, but also allows consistent
performance to make up for one slip-up.</p>
<p>An “A” grade means we are convinced that you can use the material in
this class to solve new problems and understand it well enough to
explain most concepts in the class. A “B” grade means we are convinced
that you understand the main ideas in this class well enough to be
well prepared for a follow-on course (i.e., DMT2 and other courses that include this course as a
pre-requisite).</p>
<p>Although the material we cover is challenging, and the pace may seem
overwhelming at times, we are confident that all students who put
effort into this class and take good advantage of available help will
do well.</p>
<h1 id="honor-expectations">Honor Expectations</h1>
<p>We believe strongly in the value of a community of trust, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strengthening and
enhancing that community.</p>
<p>The course will be better for everyone if everyone can assume everyone
else is trustworthy. The course staff starts with the assumption that
all students at the university deserve to be trusted.</p>
<p>To ensure that expectations are clear to everyone, all students are
required to read, understand, and sign the course pledge:
<a href="https://uvadmt.github.io/pledge">https://uvadmt.github.io/pledge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration Policy:</strong> We believe it is important for students to
learn by thinking about problems on their own, so it is expected that
each student studies the provided materials and attempts to solve the
problems on their own. After that, you are welcome to also discuss
problems on the problem sets with students and others.</p>
<p>Many problems in this course will be selected from problems used in
previous courses, as well as well known problems. The goal of these
problems is to lead students to develop understanding of the
underlying concepts by working through the problems themselves and in
discussions with others, and this goal would be defeated if you
instead use posted solutions to the problems. Other than using
solutions to the specific problems you are given, students are
encouraged to use any other resources they find helpful.</p>
<p>The collaboration policy will be described on each assignment
document. We aim to make the language describing the policy as clear
and unambiguous as possible, but if anything is ever unclear about
the stated policy for an assignment, please clarify with the course
staff. The penalty for policy violations will be considered on a
case-by-case basis, with a penalty commensurate the severity of the
offense.</p>
<h3 id="ai-tools">AI Tools</h3>
<p>Use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini on problem sets is encouraged, but like any resources you use these should be used in a way that supports your learning, is consistent with the course goals, and is fair to other students. These are powerful tools that can be great assistants and tutors to humans to use them well, and learning when and how to use these tools is itself a valuable skill.</p>
<p>However, since the goals of the course are to improve your ability as an individual to think mathematically and to understand and be able to use the methods we teach in the class, it would be counterproductive to use any resources, including AI tools, in ways that are counter to these goals. Tools can be used as shortcuts to accomplishing short term goals, such as getting a correct answer to a problem, in ways that are counter to long term goals, such as empowering yourself with new skills and understanding. Getting an answer in a way that depends on using a powerful tool can also be misleading, and make someone think they understand or are capable of doing something on their own without actually developing this. There is also a severe risk today that AI tools will give outputs that are wrong, but with language that seems convincing. Without the deeper understanding needed to interrogate the models well, users are prone to being mislead by incorrect outputs.</p>
<p>If you are not motivated by developing your abilities and gaining an appreciation of the beauty and power or mathematical thinking, though, and only want to maximize your grade while minimizing your effort, you should be aware that the tests to assess your learning in the class will be done in class and without any access to external resources. We want to see what you understand and can do on your own. The way overall grading is done in the course, it will not benefit you to get higher grades on the problem sets by using tools that prevent you from learning what you will need to understand to be able to do well on the assessments.</p>
<p>All assignments in the course will include a collaboration and resource policy which you should read and follow carefully. These will expect you to document any use of AI tools, and include links to transcripts that show your interactions with the tool. We plan to include some demonstrations using AI tools in the class, as well as specific examples of encouraged and inappropriate uses on the problem sets.</p>

If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website <a href="https://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac">https://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac</a></p>
<p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> It is the University&rsquo;s long-standing policy and
practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not
experience an adverse academic consequence when serious personal
issues conflict with academic requirements. Although University
policy only recognizes religious accomodations, the course
instructors believe they are many other valid reasons for
accomdations that are at least as justifiable as ones for religious
observance and consider family obligations, personal crises, and
extraordinary opportunities to all be potentially valid reasons for
accomodations.  Students who wish to request accommodations should
submit their request to Prof. Mahmoody or Prof. Evans as far in
advance as possible.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about the University policy on
academic accommodations for religious observance or religious
beliefs, visit
<a href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance">https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance</a>
or contact the University&rsquo;s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil
Rights (EOCR) at <code>UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</code> or 434-924-3200.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Environment:</strong> The University of Virginia is dedicated to
providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all
students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that we
and the University hold as critically important:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on grounds (including in virtual environments).</li>
</ol>
<p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal
violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence
website that describes reporting options and resources available:
<a href="https://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">https://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
<p>As your professors and as humans, know that we each care about you and
your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we
can. As faculty members, we are responsible employees, which means
that we are required by University policy and federal law to report
what you tell us to the University&rsquo;s Title IX Coordinator. The Title
IX Coordinator&rsquo;s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives
the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the
information presented to determine whether further action is necessary
to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University
community. If you would rather keep this information confidential,
there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (see
<a href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources">https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources</a>). The
worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain
silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.</p>
<p><strong>Well-being:</strong> If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated,
there are many individuals here who are ready and wanting to help. The
Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for
after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule
an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially
over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any
day: 434-295-8255.</p>
