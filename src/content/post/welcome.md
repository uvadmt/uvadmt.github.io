Welcome to cs2120: Discrete Math and Theory 1!

This is the public course website for UVA's cs2120 Spring 2025 DMT course co-taught by [David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans) and [Aidan San](https://aidansan.github.io/).

There are two sections of the course:

Our first class meetings will be on Monday, 13 January 2025.

More material will be posted here as the beginning of the semester approaches, but feel free to reach out to either of the course teachers with any questions before then.
