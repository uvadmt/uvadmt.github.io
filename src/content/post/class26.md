## Website Update

The [Problem Sets](/ps) and [Tests](/tests) are now available on easy to find pages on the course website (and the menu).

Note that we have made a update to the solution to the last problem on Test 2: it is true that the set \\( \mathbb{M} \\) only contains the element \\( \emptyset \\), but there are many _indonktive sets_ (including one that contains the elements that correspond to the set of natural numbers). The key aspect of the definition of \\( \mathbb{M} \\) is that it is the elements that are in _any_ indonktive set, so for an element to be in \\( \mathbb{M} \\) it has to be in _every_ indonktive set, and the only element that is in every indonktive set is \\( \emptyset \\). (Thanks to Alex Boback for noticing this!)
