## Schedule

- We are working hard to finish grading Test 4 as quickly as possible, and will provide details on the in-person final opportunity in class on Monday. If you want to start preparing for an anticipated final, reviewing [Tests 1-3](/tests) (including our posted comments) would certainly be worthwhile.

## Class

- All _Math_ is _Discrete Math_
- What is Math?
- From Sets to Reals

I removed some slides from the posted slides from what was done in class, but there are many public materials posted on the [DOJ's Website](https://www.justice.gov/atr/us-and-plaintiff-states-v-google-llc-2020-remedies-hearing-exhibits), including [my demonstrative slides](https://www.justice.gov/atr/media/1397911/dl?inline) (the equation we talked about is on slide 17).
