**Problem Set &omega;** is an optional problem set that is not like the others. Instead of providing an overleaf template for this, the assignment is in a Colab Notebook here: [Problem Set &omega; Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NdhFoSX1xFW9iPHgXVFydwRTbQ3O7EA4?usp=sharing).We hope you will find it worthwhile, but it is not required and not graded like the other problem sets. Read the directions in the assignment for details.

You should be able to get started on this by clicking the link above, and then select `File | Save a copy in Drive` to have an editable and executable version to use for your work. (Note that this does require a Google account. If you prefer not to have a Google account and share your work with Google (which we find admirable), you can instead download the notebook and do your work locally.)

When you are done, you will `File | Download | Downalod .ipynb` to obtain the file you will submit.
