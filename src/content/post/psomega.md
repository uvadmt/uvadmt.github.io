**Problem Set &omega;** is an _optional_ problem set that is due on 20 March, 8:29pm. 

This problem set is not like the others. Instead of providing an overleaf template for this, the assignment is in a Colab Notebook here: [Problem Set &omega; Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NdhFoSX1xFW9iPHgXVFydwRTbQ3O7EA4?usp=sharing). Note that opening the colab notebook requires having a Google account. If you prefer not to have a Google account and share your work with Google (which we find admirable), you can instead download the notebook from [https://github.com/uvadmt/uvadmt.github.io/blob/main/cs2120_psomega.ipynb] and do your work locally.

We hope you will find this assignment worthwhile, but it is not required and not graded like the other problem sets. Read the directions in the assignment for details. Also, note that the collaboration policy for this assignment is different: you can work with other students, but credit will be divided by the square root of your group size.

You should be able to get started on this by clicking the link in your favorite web browser, and then select `File | Save a copy in Drive` to have an editable and executable version to use for your work. (Note that this does require a Google account. 

When you are done, you will `File | Download | Download .ipynb` to obtain the file you will submit.
